# Overview

## Purpose of plugin

The `magento/composer-root-update-plugin` Composer plugin resolves changes that need to be made to the root project `composer.json` file before updating to a new Magento product requirement.

This is accomplished by comparing the root `composer.json` file for the Magento project corresponding to the Magento version and edition in the current installation with the Magento project `composer.json` file for the target Magento product package when the `composer require` command runs and applying any deltas found between the two files if they do not conflict with the existing `composer.json` file in the Magento root directory.
